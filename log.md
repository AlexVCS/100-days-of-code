# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: November 2nd, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I worked on my React shopping list. Added SCSS rules to optimize 4 mobile. Next, I'll be working on adding JS functionality to it. Tinkered a bit with it already.

Also worked on the Full Stack Open course. Anecdote app in the making.

**Thoughts:** Just need to keep working and getting the JS logic for the shopping list app started.

### Day 2: November 3rd, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I worked on my React portfolio site. Working on adding & formatting data for the skills page. Optimized the homepage for mobile.

Also worked on a hamburger menu nav bar for an open source project. Still have to get it implemented how Iâ€™d like.

**Thoughts**: I really need to work on better problem solving with JavaScript! That will be tomorrow's task.

**Link(s) to work**: N/A (for now)


### Day 3: November 4th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: This morning I worked on learning 2 generate a random # w/JS. Still need 2 work more with that. I looked at my React shopping list and remembered @RandallKanna
's advice: if you're having trouble w/a project build it with html, css & plain JS. I will :)

**Thoughts** I'm going to build my foundational skills for frontend more so I can get to working with frameworks and other parts of frontend development more easily.

### Day 4: November 5th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I worked on my shopping list. Setting it up and learning about how others have approach shopping lists. On the React hamburger navigation, I found an animated hamburger package that looks great. For my portfolio project I am making it more responsive and spacing things out a bit better.

**Thoughts** Each day I code and each day I learn a little more. Some days feel better than others but as long as I code each day I'm happy.

### Day 5: November 6th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Focus was Full Stack Open curriculum. I'm working on the anecdotes app. Reviewed sample code and have generated a function to select a random anecdote. Need to figure out the implementation. Made a couple corrections to an open source project too.

**Thoughts** Feel close to getting the anecdote app working. Need to keep tinkering with it.

**Link(s) to work**: N/A (for now)

### Day 6: November 7th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Continued with the anecdotes app. Took some code I've written in an earlier part of the course and used it there. Was a fly on the wall for a Zoom call were friends where working on testing a Golang app. Tiny tweaks to my React hamburger nav.

**Thoughts** Even when I'm tired I'm coding and though it's difficult I'm persisting.

**Link(s) to work**: N/A (for now)

### Day 7: November 8th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Got the random anecdotes app working. Thanks to Eliot for looking at my code. Worked on the Pure React course and hooped on a Code Book Club call.

**Thoughts** Everyday I code.

### Day 8: November 9th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Continued with Full Stack Open. Went to part two and reviewed/used map, filter and reduce functions in JS. Started the new MERNG course from freeCodeCamp too. Enjoying the process of daily coding.

**Thoughts** MongoDB and GraphQL have been talked about by other developers I know a lot. I'm excited to work with them more in my projects.

**Link(s) to work**: N/A (for now)

### Day 9: November 10th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Did more of the freeCodeCamp MERNG course. Setup a MongoDB database and built out GraphQL schema. Reviewed React documentation, it's good to take a step back and remember what's at the core of your stack.

**Thoughts** I may take a little detour from what I've been working on and explore Next.js. Keep hearing good things about it and want to know a little more about it.

### Day 10: November 11th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Tried out Next.js for the first time. After hearing lots about it I needed to see for myself. Love it so far! I went through the well written tutorial to start a simple blog. It's optimized nicely and has nice built in features on top of React. Look forward to doing more with it. Unfortunately my left hand doesn't like all the coding I've been doing it seems. Have to try & minimize the typing with it atm.

**Thoughts** It's so fun when you try something new and have an awesome experience.

### Day 11: November 12th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Got back to Full Stack Open. Always good to remember the console is your friend! Starting to solve issues with logging to the console first is a game changer. I did that and will work from there. Continued with the Next.js blog too :)

**Thoughts** Little bits of progress seem small but in the big scheme of things mean a lot!

### Day 12: November 13th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: More progress with the Next.js blog. See myself using Next to create apps in the future. Looked more at the anecdotes app I've been building, trying to add onto the logic I have, research and programmatically problem solve. Booyah!

**Thoughts** No matter how tired I may be I code.
