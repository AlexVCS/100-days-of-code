# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: November 2nd, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I worked on my React shopping list. Added SCSS rules to optimize 4 mobile. Next, I'll be working on adding JS functionality to it. Tinkered a bit with it already.

Also worked on the Full Stack Open course. Anecdote app in the making.

**Thoughts:** Just need to keep working and getting the JS logic for the shopping list app started.

### Day 2: November 3rd, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I worked on my React portfolio site. Working on adding & formatting data for the skills page. Optimized the homepage for mobile.

Also worked on a hamburger menu nav bar for an open source project. Still have to get it implemented how Iâ€™d like.

**Thoughts**: I really need to work on better problem solving with JavaScript! That will be tomorrow's task.

### Day 3: November 4th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: This morning I worked on learning 2 generate a random # w/JS. Still need 2 work more with that. I looked at my React shopping list and remembered @RandallKanna
's advice: if you're having trouble w/a project build it with html, css & plain JS. I will :)

**Thoughts** I'm going to build my foundational skills for frontend more so I can get to working with frameworks and other parts of frontend development more easily.

### Day 4: November 5th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I worked on my shopping list. Setting it up and learning about how others have approach shopping lists. On the React hamburger navigation, I found an animated hamburger package that looks great. For my portfolio project I am making it more responsive and spacing things out a bit better.

**Thoughts** Each day I code and each day I learn a little more. Some days feel better than others but as long as I code each day I'm happy.

**Link(s) to work**: N/A (for now)

### Day 5: November 6th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Focus was Full Stack Open curriculum. I'm working on the anecdotes app. Reviewed sample code and have generated a function to select a random anecdote. Need to figure out the implementation. Made a couple corrections to an open source project too.

**Thoughts** Feel close to getting the anecdote app working. Need to keep tinkering with it.

**Link(s) to work**: N/A (for now)

### Day 6: November 7th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Continued with the anecdotes app. Took some code I've written in an earlier part of the course and used it there. Was a fly on the wall for a Zoom call were friends where working on testing a Golang app. Tiny tweaks to my React hamburger nav.

**Thoughts** Even when I'm tired I'm coding and though it's difficult I'm persisting.

**Link(s) to work**: N/A (for now)

### Day 7: November 8th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Got the random anecdotes app working. Thanks to Eliot for looking at my code. Worked on the Pure React course and hooped on a Code Book Club call.

**Thoughts** Everyday I code.

**Link(s) to work**: N/A (for now)

### Day 8: November 9th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Continued with Full Stack Open. Went to part two and reviewed/used map, filter and reduce functions in JS. Started the new MERNG course from freeCodeCamp too. Enjoying the process of daily coding.

**Thoughts** MongoDB and GraphQL have been talked about by other developers I know a lot. I'm excited to work with them more in my projects.

**Link(s) to work**: N/A (for now)

### Day 9: November 10th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Did more of the freeCodeCamp MERNG course. Setup a MongoDB database and built out GraphQL schema. Reviewed React documentation, it's good to take a step back and remember what's at the core of your stack.

**Thoughts** I may take a little detour from what I've been working on and explore Next.js. Keep hearing good things about it and want to know a little more about it.

**Link(s) to work**: N/A (for now)

### Day 10: November 11th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Tried out Next.js for the first time. After hearing lots about it I needed to see for myself. Love it so far! I went through the well written tutorial to start a simple blog. It's optimized nicely and has nice built in features on top of React. Look forward to doing more with it. Unfortunately my left hand doesn't like all the coding I've been doing it seems. Have to try & minimize the typing with it atm.

**Thoughts** It's so fun when you try something new and have an awesome experience.

### Day 11: November 12th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Got back to Full Stack Open. Always good to remember the console is your friend! Starting to solve issues with logging to the console first is a game changer. I did that and will work from there. Continued with the Next.js blog too :)

**Thoughts** Little bits of progress seem small but in the big scheme of things mean a lot!

**Link(s) to work**: https://github.com/AlexVCS/Full-stack-open-2020

### Day 12: November 13th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: More progress with the Next.js blog. See myself using Next to create apps in the future. Looked more at the anecdotes app I've been building, trying to add onto the logic I have, research and programmatically problem solve. Booyah!

**Thoughts** No matter how tired I may be I code.

**Link(s) to work**: https://github.com/AlexVCS/nextjs-blog

### Day 13: November 14th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Went back to building the shopping list. Deleted a lot of the code I wrote for it and have added in new code. Looked at my React portfolio, it's looking fine just needs real data instead of mock. For the Next.js blog I created an API route.

**Thoughts** Confidence is key and I need to have confidence in me.

**Link(s) to work**: N/A (for now)

### Day 14: November 15th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Got on a Code Book Club call. As a group we finished a code wars problem we've been tackling the last few weeks. Then we had a blast solving another problem! Anecdotes app is slowly progressing, I'm using my good ol' buddy the JS console and logging better than I was. More to come on that :)

**Thoughts** Having fun with the coding community makes the whole experience of coding that much more fun.

**Link(s) to work**: https://github.com/AlexVCS/Full-stack-open-2020

### Day 15: November 16th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Anecdotes app is so close to being where I want it. I'm trying different logic and will get it straightened out in the next two days. I deployed my first project to Vercel. Seamless setup no complaints :)

**Thoughts** Sometimes git throws all kinds of fits at me and it's overwhelming lol!

### Day 16: November 17th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Shopping list tinkering happened today. Anecdotes app got my attention too and more to come to get it done. Explored learning Node.js some today too. Here's to more code being pushed Wed!

**Thoughts** Today I didn't do as much as much with the actual code and tomorrow I'll do more.

### Day 17: November 18th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Got the anecdotes app to store the votes! Thanks to Jess for hopping on a chat to code through the problem and optimize the initial solution. Hopped on a Zoom call to learn more about shell script commands. Tried and learned a bunch of new commands :)

**Thoughts** It's awesome to collaborate with others and work through coding challenges.

**Link(s) to work**: N/A (for now)

### Day 18: November 19th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Cleaned up code in the anecdotes app. Adding code that will display the anecdote with the most votes soon. Looked at part two of Full Stack Open and am coding along with explanations.

**Thoughts** Consistency makes you so much better at coding!

**Link(s) to work**: N/A (for now)

### Day 19: November 20th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Reading and coding in part 2 of Full Stack Open. Worked on some React exercises on FreeCodeCamp. Also setup more of the MERNG app from FCC's video course. Even when you're tired you've got to bring your best to the keyboard :)

**Thoughts** While it feels like not much code gets written some days, some is always better than none.

### Day 20: November 21th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Loving basketball I began creating a new project that I want to use an API with to get info about bball. Found an API, may explore others and display stats and have it look neat. Reviewed about the JS Fetch API and added some JSON data for Full Stack Open.

**Thoughts** It was hard for me to code today but I did.

**Link(s) to work**: N/A (for now)

### Day 21: November 22nd, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Was on a Code Book Club call about the YDKJS book. We talked about the values chapter. Funny how 0.1 + 0.2 does not equal 0.3 in JavaScript. It's a great group and there's always new info worth diving into during and after the calls. I worked on Full Stack Open too, trying but still not solving. Not giving up and also looked at the next.js blog I'd like to add a dark mode toggle.

**Thoughts** Community matters.

**Link(s) to work**: N/A (for now)

### Day 22: November 23rd, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Got the anecdotes app working! Always helps to have someone review your code and advise you in the right direction. This community always amazes. Continued on with the part 2 exercises of Full Stack Open. Got a little further into the MERNG app video from FreeCodeCamp too.

**Thoughts** I'm stoked to keep going and making strides daily :)

### Day 23: November 24th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Worked on my vanilla JS shopping list. Lots more to come but when you type in an item it adds it to a ul. For Full Stack Open I'm working on debugging my solution for exercise 2.1 with console.logs.

**Thoughts** DuckDuckGo and VS Code are the main vessels for getting my code right!

**Link(s) to work**: https://github.com/AlexVCS/Shopping-List-Vanilla-JS

### Day 24: November 25th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Keyed in on debugging for Full Stack Open. I know where the problem lies and know I will rectify it soon! Made changes to see if and how that would change the application. Think it got a little better :)

**Thoughts** Errors are a pain but when they go away I can see the gains!

**Link(s) to work**: https://github.com/AlexVCS/Full-stack-open-2020

### Day 25: November 26th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Shopping list works better now. Append an li inside a ul to the DOM. Excited to tinker with it and get more of the behaviors I want out of it. Bit of progress and coding to start the day, now to enjoy Thanksgiving :)

**Thoughts** I love getting functions to work as I'd like them to, it feels great!

**Link(s) to work**: N/A (for now)

### Day 26: November 27th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Removed unnecessary code for the shopping list. Baby steps haha but the console is happier now. Working to debug code for Full Stack Open, gotta love & trust the process.

**Thoughts** Bugs are my arch nemesis and I will face them head on!

**Link(s) to work**: N/A (for now)

### Day 27: November 28th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Got further with Full Stack Open! JS map is awesome and I'm glad I got that working. Such an exhilarating feeling to get past the bugs. Went through a bit more of the MERNG app video and learned why PostgreSQL is gaining popularity.

**Thoughts** I can do this I just have to persist despite resistance.

**Link(s) to work**: N/A (for now)

### Day 28: November 29th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Hopped on a CodeBookClub call. We worked on a codewars problem and used Regex to solve it! I shared my screen and wrote code based on what we as a group would work best. I continued with Full Stack Open. Oh the ebb and flow of building and breaking your application! Haha. Worked on my shopping list also.

**Thoughts** Always nice to work with other developers.

**Link(s) to work**: N/A (for now)

### Day 29: November 30th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Continuing to work on the shopping list. Have the basic functionality just want to add some layers onto that. Learned a bit of Svelte today. Awesome stuff! It's always astonishing to think about all the different avenues coding can take you down :)

**Thoughts** More to learn than there is time, best to always make time to learn.

**Link(s) to work**: https://github.com/AlexVCS/Shopping-List-Vanilla-JS

### Day 30: December 1st, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Continued learning Svelte. Learned a bit more about Node and explored Tailwind CSS too. Shopping list is still being tinkered with, it's almost there.

**Thoughts** Staying consistent and learning to enjoy what I'm working on more and more are the keys to my success right now.

**Link(s) to work**: N/A (for now)

### Day 31: December 2nd, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Shopping list refinements are happening. Gaining clarity on how I'd like it to function. Learned more Node.

**Thoughts** I like pushing more code than I did today, but hey I did push some code at least.

**Link(s) to work**: N/A (for now)

### Day 32: December 3rd, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Changed the layout for my shopping list items. Made it look more like they're on a notepad. The looks feels more realistic. I like it :)

**Thoughts** It's great when you get great ideas and implement them into projects!

**Link(s) to work**: N/A (for now)

### Day 33: December 4th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Adjusted my course-info app for Full Stack Open. Got away from the sea of errors and have it rendering. Still need to get everything I need to render however. For the shopping list I changed the styling on a few things as a test.

**Thoughts** Coding everyday like my keyboard is a hot spring.

**Link(s) to work**: N/A (for now)

### Day 34: December 5th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Worked on JS algorithms a bit on FreeCodeCamp. For Full Stack Open, I am debugging a map function. Looked into open source contributions and hope to make many!

**Thoughts** Even on hard days I code and that's great.

**Link(s) to work**: N/A (for now)

### Day 35: December 6th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Began setting up a phonebook app for Full Stack Open. Got on a Code Book Club call about the YDKJS book. Always a blast to learn with others and still have community even in 2020!

**Thoughts** A little code each day goes a long way.

**Link(s) to work**: N/A (for now)

### Day 36: December 7th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the way items are spaced out when they're added to the shopping list. The header is flowing better with different viewports too. Got on codedamn as directed from a FreeCodeCamp article. Worked on a bit of React inside one of their classrooms. 

**Thoughts** Keep at it, that's what counts.

**Link(s) to work**: https://github.com/AlexVCS/Shopping-List-Vanilla-JS

### Day 37: December 8th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Continuing to test out ways to render all the content for my course-info app. Started a simple Svelte app, poked around on it and hope to get more used to Svelte in time. Slow but steady progress.

**Thoughts** Above all code and leave as much else to be as possible.

**Link(s) to work**: N/A (for now)

### Day 38: December 9th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Created another map function and have more content rendering on my course-info app! Seeing more of what you've been trying to render when coding is quite the dopamine rush! Added more content to my Svelte app. Cool to use that as a little Svelte playground ;)

**Thoughts** I be coding everyday and I there's no end in sight.

**Link(s) to work**: N/A (for now)

### Day 39: December 10th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Made more improvements to my course-info app. Got on a call with my friend Jess. He looked at my code and made helpful suggestions. Getting another set of eyes on your code can help big time when you aren't clear on how to move forward. Make notes to reference and seek out code reviews as needed.

**Thoughts** The coding community is outstanding.
