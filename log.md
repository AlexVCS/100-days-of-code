# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: November 2nd, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I worked on my React shopping list. Added SCSS rules to optimize 4 mobile. Next, I'll be working on adding JS functionality to it. Tinkered a bit with it already.

Also worked on the Full Stack Open course. Anecdote app in the making.

**Thoughts:** Just need to keep working and getting the JS logic for the shopping list app started.

### Day 2: November 3rd, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I worked on my React portfolio site. Working on adding & formatting data for the skills page. Optimized the homepage for mobile.

Also worked on a hamburger menu nav bar for an open source project. Still have to get it implemented how Iâ€™d like.

**Thoughts**: I really need to work on better problem solving with JavaScript! That will be tomorrow's task.

**Link(s) to work**: N/A (for now)


### Day 3: November 4th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: This morning I worked on learning 2 generate a random # w/JS. Still need 2 work more with that. I looked at my React shopping list and remembered @RandallKanna
's advice: if you're having trouble w/a project build it with html, css & plain JS. I will :)

**Thoughts** I'm going to build my foundational skills for frontend more so I can get to working with frameworks and other parts of frontend development more easily.
