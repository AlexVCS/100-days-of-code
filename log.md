# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: November 2nd, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I worked on my React shopping list. Added SCSS rules to optimize 4 mobile. Next, I'll be working on adding JS functionality to it. Tinkered a bit with it already.

Also worked on the Full Stack Open course. Anecdote app in the making.

**Thoughts:** Just need to keep working and getting the JS logic for the shopping list app started.

### Day 2: November 3rd, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I worked on my React portfolio site. Working on adding & formatting data for the skills page. Optimized the homepage for mobile.

Also worked on a hamburger menu nav bar for an open source project. Still have to get it implemented how Iâ€™d like.

**Thoughts**: I really need to work on better problem solving with JavaScript! That will be tomorrow's task.

### Day 3: November 4th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: This morning I worked on learning 2 generate a random # w/JS. Still need 2 work more with that. I looked at my React shopping list and remembered @RandallKanna
's advice: if you're having trouble w/a project build it with html, css & plain JS. I will :)

**Thoughts** I'm going to build my foundational skills for frontend more so I can get to working with frameworks and other parts of frontend development more easily.

### Day 4: November 5th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I worked on my shopping list. Setting it up and learning about how others have approach shopping lists. On the React hamburger navigation, I found an animated hamburger package that looks great. For my portfolio project I am making it more responsive and spacing things out a bit better.

**Thoughts** Each day I code and each day I learn a little more. Some days feel better than others but as long as I code each day I'm happy.

### Day 5: November 6th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Focus was Full Stack Open curriculum. I'm working on the anecdotes app. Reviewed sample code and have generated a function to select a random anecdote. Need to figure out the implementation. Made a couple corrections to an open source project too.

**Thoughts** Feel close to getting the anecdote app working. Need to keep tinkering with it.

### Day 6: November 7th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Continued with the anecdotes app. Took some code I've written in an earlier part of the course and used it there. Was a fly on the wall for a Zoom call were friends where working on testing a Golang app. Tiny tweaks to my React hamburger nav.

**Thoughts** Even when I'm tired I'm coding and though it's difficult I'm persisting.
