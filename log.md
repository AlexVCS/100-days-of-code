# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: November 2nd, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I worked on my React shopping list. Added SCSS rules to optimize 4 mobile. Next, I'll be working on adding JS functionality to it. Tinkered a bit with it already.

Also worked on the Full Stack Open course. Anecdote app in the making.

**Thoughts:** Just need to keep working and getting the JS logic for the shopping list app started.

### Day 2: November 3rd, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I worked on my React portfolio site. Working on adding & formatting data for the skills page. Optimized the homepage for mobile.

Also worked on a hamburger menu nav bar for an open source project. Still have to get it implemented how Iâ€™d like.

**Thoughts**: I really need to work on better problem solving with JavaScript! That will be tomorrow's task.

**Link(s) to work**: N/A (for now)

### Day 3: November 4th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: This morning I worked on learning 2 generate a random # w/JS. Still need 2 work more with that. I looked at my React shopping list and remembered @RandallKanna
's advice: if you're having trouble w/a project build it with html, css & plain JS. I will :)

**Thoughts** I'm going to build my foundational skills for frontend more so I can get to working with frameworks and other parts of frontend development more easily.

**Link(s) to work**: N/A (for now)

### Day 4: November 5th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I worked on my shopping list. Setting it up and learning about how others have approach shopping lists. On the React hamburger navigation, I found an animated hamburger package that looks great. For my portfolio project I am making it more responsive and spacing things out a bit better.

**Thoughts** Each day I code and each day I learn a little more. Some days feel better than others but as long as I code each day I'm happy.

**Link(s) to work**: N/A (for now)

### Day 5: November 6th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Focus was Full Stack Open curriculum. I'm working on the anecdotes app. Reviewed sample code and have generated a function to select a random anecdote. Need to figure out the implementation. Made a couple corrections to an open source project too.

**Thoughts** Feel close to getting the anecdote app working. Need to keep tinkering with it.

**Link(s) to work**: N/A (for now)

### Day 6: November 7th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Continued with the anecdotes app. Took some code I've written in an earlier part of the course and used it there. Was a fly on the wall for a Zoom call were friends where working on testing a Golang app. Tiny tweaks to my React hamburger nav.

**Thoughts** Even when I'm tired I'm coding and though it's difficult I'm persisting.

**Link(s) to work**: N/A (for now)

### Day 7: November 8th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Got the random anecdotes app working. Thanks to Eliot for looking at my code. Worked on the Pure React course and hooped on a Code Book Club call.

**Thoughts** Everyday I code.

**Link(s) to work**: N/A (for now)

### Day 8: November 9th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Continued with Full Stack Open. Went to part two and reviewed/used map, filter and reduce functions in JS. Started the new MERNG course from freeCodeCamp too. Enjoying the process of daily coding.

**Thoughts** MongoDB and GraphQL have been talked about by other developers I know a lot. I'm excited to work with them more in my projects.

**Link(s) to work**: N/A (for now)

### Day 9: November 10th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Did more of the freeCodeCamp MERNG course. Setup a MongoDB database and built out GraphQL schema. Reviewed React documentation, it's good to take a step back and remember what's at the core of your stack.

**Thoughts** I may take a little detour from what I've been working on and explore Next.js. Keep hearing good things about it and want to know a little more about it.

**Link(s) to work**: N/A (for now)

### Day 10: November 11th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Tried out Next.js for the first time. After hearing lots about it I needed to see for myself. Love it so far! I went through the well written tutorial to start a simple blog. It's optimized nicely and has nice built in features on top of React. Look forward to doing more with it. Unfortunately my left hand doesn't like all the coding I've been doing it seems. Have to try & minimize the typing with it atm.

**Thoughts** It's so fun when you try something new and have an awesome experience.

**Link(s) to work**: https://github.com/AlexVCS/nextjs-blog

### Day 11: November 12th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Got back to Full Stack Open. Always good to remember the console is your friend! Starting to solve issues with logging to the console first is a game changer. I did that and will work from there. Continued with the Next.js blog too :)

**Thoughts** Little bits of progress seem small but in the big scheme of things mean a lot!

**Link(s) to work**: https://github.com/AlexVCS/Full-stack-open-2020

### Day 12: November 13th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: More progress with the Next.js blog. See myself using Next to create apps in the future. Looked more at the anecdotes app I've been building, trying to add onto the logic I have, research and programmatically problem solve. Booyah!

**Thoughts** No matter how tired I may be I code.

**Link(s) to work**: https://github.com/AlexVCS/nextjs-blog

### Day 13: November 14th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Went back to building the shopping list. Deleted a lot of the code I wrote for it and have added in new code. Looked at my React portfolio, it's looking fine just needs real data instead of mock. For the Next.js blog I created an API route.

**Thoughts** Confidence is key and I need to have confidence in me.

**Link(s) to work**: N/A (for now)

### Day 14: November 15th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Got on a Code Book Club call. As a group we finished a code wars problem we've been tackling the last few weeks. Then we had a blast solving another problem! Anecdotes app is slowly progressing, I'm using my good ol' buddy the JS console and logging better than I was. More to come on that :)

**Thoughts** Having fun with the coding community makes the whole experience of coding that much more fun.

**Link(s) to work**: https://github.com/AlexVCS/Full-stack-open-2020

**Today's Progress**: Anecdotes app is so close to being where I want it. I'm trying different logic and will get it straightened out in the next two days. I deployed my first project to Vercel. Seamless setup no complaints :)

**Thoughts** Sometimes git throws all kinds of fits at me and it's overwhelming lol!

**Link(s) to work**: https://nextjs-blog-sigma-seven-86.vercel.app/

### Day 16: November 17th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Shopping list tinkering happened today. Anecdotes app got my attention too and more to come to get it done. Explored learning Node.js some today too. Here's to more code being pushed Wed!

**Thoughts** Today I didn't do as much as much with the actual code and tomorrow I'll do more.

**Link(s) to work**: N/A (for now)

### Day 17: November 18th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Got the anecdotes app to store the votes! Thanks to Jess for hopping on a chat to code through the problem and optimize the initial solution. Hopped on a Zoom call to learn more about shell script commands. Tried and learned a bunch of new commands :)

**Thoughts** It's awesome to collaborate with others and work through coding challenges.

**Link(s) to work**: N/A (for now)

### Day 18: November 19th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Cleaned up code in the anecdotes app. Adding code that will display the anecdote with the most votes soon. Looked at part two of Full Stack Open and am coding along with explanations.

### Day 20: November 21th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Loving basketball I began creating a new project that I want to use an API with to get info about bball. Found an API, may explore others and display stats and have it look neat. Reviewed about the JS Fetch API and added some JSON data for Full Stack Open.

**Thoughts** It was hard for me to code today but I did.

**Link(s) to work**: N/A (for now)

### Day 21: November 22nd, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Was on a Code Book Club call about the YDKJS book. We talked about the values chapter. Funny how 0.1 + 0.2 does not equal 0.3 in JavaScript. It's a great group and there's always new info worth diving into during and after the calls. I worked on Full Stack Open too, trying but still not solving. Not giving up and also looked at the next.js blog I'd like to add a dark mode toggle.

**Thoughts** Community matters.

**Link(s) to work**: N/A (for now)

### Day 22: November 23rd, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Got the anecdotes app working! Always helps to have someone review your code and advise you in the right direction. This community always amazes. Continued on with the part 2 exercises of Full Stack Open. Got a little further into the MERNG app video from FreeCodeCamp too.

**Thoughts** I'm stoked to keep going and making strides daily :)

**Link(s) to work**: https://github.com/AlexVCS/Full-stack-open-2020

### Day 23: November 24th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Worked on my vanilla JS shopping list. Lots more to come but when you type in an item it adds it to a ul. For Full Stack Open I'm working on debugging my solution for exercise 2.1 with console.logs.

**Thoughts** DuckDuckGo and VS Code are the main vessels for getting my code right!

**Link(s) to work**: https://github.com/AlexVCS/Shopping-List-Vanilla-JS

### Day 24: November 25th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Keyed in on debugging for Full Stack Open. I know where the problem lies and know I will rectify it soon! Made changes to see if and how that would change the application. Think it got a little better :)

**Thoughts** Errors are a pain but when they go away I can see the gains!

**Link(s) to work**: https://github.com/AlexVCS/Full-stack-open-2020

### Day 25: November 26th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Shopping list works better now. Append an li inside a ul to the DOM. Excited to tinker with it and get more of the behaviors I want out of it. Bit of progress and coding to start the day, now to enjoy Thanksgiving :)

**Link(s) to work**: N/A (for now)

### Day 28: November 29th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Hopped on a CodeBookClub call. We worked on a codewars problem and used Regex to solve it! I shared my screen and wrote code based on what we as a group would work best. I continued with Full Stack Open. Oh the ebb and flow of building and breaking your application! Haha. Worked on my shopping list also.

**Thoughts** Always nice to work with other developers.

**Link(s) to work**: N/A (for now)

### Day 29: November 30th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Continuing to work on the shopping list. Have the basic functionality just want to add some layers onto that. Learned a bit of Svelte today. Awesome stuff! It's always astonishing to think about all the different avenues coding can take you down :)

**Thoughts** More to learn than there is time, best to always make time to learn.

**Link(s) to work**: https://github.com/AlexVCS/Shopping-List-Vanilla-JS

### Day 30: December 1st, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Continued learning Svelte. Learned a bit more about Node and explored Tailwind CSS too. Shopping list is still being tinkered with, it's almost there.

**Thoughts** Staying consistent and learning to enjoy what I'm working on more and more are the keys to my success right now.

**Link(s) to work**: N/A (for now)

### Day 31: December 2nd, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Shopping list refinements are happening. Gaining clarity on how I'd like it to function. Learned more Node.

**Link(s) to work**: N/A (for now)

### Day 41: December 12th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Using and learning about Axios. I promise it'll make a difference in my codebase ;) Can tell familiarity with Axios is important as it's widely used (and easy to use).

**Thoughts** As long as I code I know I make strides.

**Link(s) to work**: N/A (for now)

### Day 42: December 13th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Took part in a Code Book Club call. We worked on a challenge from the Advent of Code day 7. First time looking more at one these and it was intricate! Worked more on FSO, excited to get back to coding in the morning which is when I work best :)

**Thoughts** Coding in the morning works best for me.

**Link(s) to work**: N/A (for now)

### Day 43: December 14th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Working on the phonebook for FSO. Added a function that stores the name being written in the input field. Wrote filter and map functions to try and add that name underneath the numbers header but the functionality isn't there just yet. Need to refactor. Began familiarizing myself with a React app that uses Typescript.

**Thoughts** Coded earlier in the day and got a lot more done.

**Thoughts** Excited to keep coding and improving.

**Link(s) to work**: https://github.com/AlexVCS/Mango-Project

### Day 48: December 19th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Added buttons to the mango app. Starting to write out JS. Early stages but it's happening. Using Tailwind it's nice to just stay in one file when styling for the most part. Easier than jumping from HTML to SCSS or from JS when working with React.

**Thoughts** Time to take this mango project to the next level.

**Link(s) to work**: N/A (for now)

### Day 49: December 20th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Created an array that has all the mango information I want to display for my app. Began to write a map function to display it to the page. Got on a Code Book Club call. We started the call talking about a chapter from the YDKJS book. It was about coercion. We did a quiz as a group and discussed the chapter a bit. Then we got returned to solving the advent of code challenge from last week. We still haven't finished but saw amazing strides made by our coder Amanda in particular. She is working diligently to solve the problem. Others are chiming in too of course.

**Thoughts** Lots of coding today!

**Link(s) to work**: N/A (for now)

### Day 50: December 21th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Worked more on the mango and phonebook projects. Have the person's name being added, more to come. Did some SASS exercises on Free Code Camp. Good review :)

**Thoughts** I am coding despite it being NYE. Nice

**Link(s) to work**: N/A (for now)

### Day 61: January 1st, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Got the beginnings of the mad libzz app rendering. Always remember to really read over your code. Had an extra s when I was setting data equal to a state variable. Made everything wonky. Double check your code, you'll be glad you did.

**Thoughts** Coding through the bugs like an exterminator :)

**Link(s) to work**: N/A (for now)

### Day 62: January 2nd, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Styled the mad-libzz game a bit. Add a header and figured out what background I'd like, etc. Looks a little better and the next task is to add more functionality. Close to finishing the regex exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** Mad Libzz game is going to be cool. Do you even API bro?

**Link(s) to work**: N/A (for now)

### Day 63: January 3rd, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the phonebook app a bit. Changing an if else statement and still need to work on the implementation. Got on a Code Book Club call. We talked about the YDKJS then finished going over an Advent of Code challenge!

**Thoughts** Not a bad week, but next week I'm excited to push even more code ;)

**Link(s) to work**: N/A (for now)

### Day 64: January 4th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Had a call with friends who are working on the Mad Libzz game. We worked together and made key updates to a friends game and mine. Now we are storing input updates in state. Next step is to put the inputs into a story!

**Thoughts** Coding with others and having multiple people offer ideas is awesome :)

**Link(s) to work**: N/A (for now)

### Day 65: January 5th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Wrote a bit of code that will make the Mad Libzz game better in the end. An alert if the user doesn't fill in all the blanks, a new game button that will come up with the finished story and the first bits of the renderStory function.

**Thoughts** Tired, so tired, but I still got on and wrote code.

**Link(s) to work**: N/A (for now)

### Day 66: January 6th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Wrote more logic for the Mad Libzz game. Worked on JS regex on FreeCodeCamp, almost finished :)

**Thoughts** I am going to code and be more productive tomorrow.

**Link(s) to work**: N/A (for now)

### Day 67: January 7th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Finished regex exercises on FreeCodeCamp! Started & finished the JS debugging section and started the basic data structures exercises. Worked on the Mad Libzz game-will continue to write logic to render out the story.

**Thoughts** Staying consistent is fantastic.

**Link(s) to work**: N/A (for now)

### Day 69: January 9th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Made strides on my mad libzz and phonebook apps. I'm conditionally rendering the blanks and upon clicking submit the story renders with what the user typed in the blanks. The phonebook now gives you an alert if you try to add an already existing name and accepts phone numbers in addition to name.

**Thoughts** Love days when I make big stries-time to keep up the momentum!

**Link(s) to work**: N/A (for now)

### Day 70: January 10th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Jumped on a Code Book Club call. We solved a code wars problem. Using JS we were given three numbers and needed to write code to break them up (750 to 700 + 50, for example). Psuedo code helps us hash out our ideas and then implement them step by step. Made changes to the Mad Libzz app and have a new bug to figure out!

**Thoughts** Not a bad week for coding. Not bad at all!

### Day 71: January 11th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Added more styling for the Mad Libzz game. Still needs additional changes but the alignment of the inputs and word types is better! Got on a call with friends and we went over some key JS concepts. What are the types in JS, differences between arrays and objects, common array methods and more :)

**Thoughts** Keeping the flow going and not stopping.
