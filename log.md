# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: November 2nd, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I worked on my React shopping list. Added SCSS rules to optimize 4 mobile. Next, I'll be working on adding JS functionality to it. Tinkered a bit with it already.

Also worked on the Full Stack Open course. Anecdote app in the making.

**Thoughts:** Just need to keep working and getting the JS logic for the shopping list app started.

### Day 2: November 3rd, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I worked on my React portfolio site. Working on adding & formatting data for the skills page. Optimized the homepage for mobile.

Also worked on a hamburger menu nav bar for an open source project. Still have to get it implemented how Iâ€™d like.

**Thoughts**: I really need to work on better problem solving with JavaScript! That will be tomorrow's task.

**Link(s) to work**: N/A (for now)


### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
